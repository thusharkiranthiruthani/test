Exposed Web Server Version Information (nginx/1.20.0)

Description
During the analysis, it was observed that the application disclosed detailed web server information in the HTTP response headers. Specifically, the Server header revealed the underlying server software and its version as nginx/1.20.0.
Such information disclosure can aid an attacker in identifying the exact technology stack and version in use. Using this information, an attacker can search for publicly known vulnerabilities or exploits associated with that specific server version and leverage them to compromise the target system.

Exposing version details like this also increases the attack surface and provides unnecessary insights into the application’s backend infrastructure.

Evidence
In the below screenshot, it was observed that the HTTP response header contained the following entry:

Server: nginx/1.20.0

This confirms that the web server is leaking version information to unauthenticated users.

Resolution
It is recommended to suppress or obfuscate detailed server information in HTTP response headers. The following actions are advised:

Disable or modify the Server header to remove version details. For nginx, configure the directive in nginx.conf:

server_tokens off;

Review and disable any other headers that disclose framework or technology versions (e.g., X-Powered-By).

Reflected input in JSON responses (no XSS observed)

Description
During the analysis, it was observed that user-supplied input is reflected verbatim in JSON responses from multiple API endpoints. The application returns these values in the response body (Content-Type: application/json) without server-side sanitization or encoding. Proof-of-concept payloads (e.g. </script><script>alert(1)</script>) were reflected in responses but did not execute in the tested client — the payloads were rendered as raw data and no browser-executed script was observed. Despite the lack of observed execution, returning unescaped attacker-controlled data increases the risk that a client-side rendering change or a third-party consumer could later interpret the data as executable HTML/JS.

Evidence

Screenshots show JSON responses containing injected strings such as:

"businessUnity97c<script>alert(1)</script>dkamw":[

and similar reflections across multiple endpoints.

PoC attempts with </script><script>alert(1)</script> were reflected in the API response but did not execute in the browser during testing.

Resolution
It is recommended to apply both server- and client-side mitigations:

Server-side: validate and normalize all input; reject or sanitize input that includes unexpected HTML/JS where not required. Ensure JSON responses are generated via proper serializers and not by manual string concatenation.

Client-side: treat all API data as untrusted. Render values using safe methods (e.g., textContent/innerText or escaping templating engines) and avoid innerHTML, document.write, eval, or jQuery .html() with untrusted data. If rendering HTML is necessary, sanitize with a vetted library (e.g., DOMPurify) before insertion.
